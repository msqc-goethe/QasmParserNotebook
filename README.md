# OpenQASM Parsing Library Notebook

This repository holds a jupyter notebook, describing the installation and examplary use cases of the OpenQASM Parsing library. 
Since the installation will alter the available Python site packages, it is highly emphasized to run the installation, and therefore the notebook, in a virtual environment.

For a more in depth description of the OpenQASM Parser library, please refer to (this repository)[https://github.com/msqc-goethe/QasmParserLibrary].
