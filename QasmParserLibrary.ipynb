    "# OpenQASM Parser Library\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is intended to provide an insight into the _OpenQASM Parser Library_, able to parse a common quantum circuit description format used in the context of variational algorithms into the corresponding OpenQASM representation, utilizing parallel computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to use the library additional libraries must be installed. These include:\n",
    "- OpenMP\n",
    "- Thread Building Blocks (TBB)\n",
    "- fmt\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, we are using [*cmake*](https://cmake.org/download/) (already installed on many systems or part of the package manager) as our generator and GCC as our compiler. If not yet the default C/C++ compiler, install the *GNU Compiler Collection* (GCC) as your compiler to use the library. Some older versions of the GCC may must be upgraded to be used with the library. The reason for that is the necessity to use the execution policies first implemented in the C++17 standard. The GCC can be an globally existing binary, but other than that I would highly emphasize using a virtual environment, since we will install the library as an C++ Python binding and one probably does not want to install everything globally and eventually mess with the system on a global scale. An easy to use and project compatible virtual environment manager is [*Anaconda*](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html). Install Anaconda on your system and [create a virtual environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) with a fairly new Python version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the used environment manager is Anaconda, installing the additional necessary libraries can be done like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge openmp\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge tbb\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge fmt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding the Library to the Python Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "After cloning the project in an appropriate location, we need to build and install the library. Therefore, the location of your Python *site-packages* folder must be known. The path can be found using `python -m site` command in a shell/terminal session. Be aware that the python binary pointed to is the correct one, meaning the one you want to be using. Verify by first executing `which python` and confirm that the path leads to your desired binary. In a virtual environment this should point to a binary in your virtual environment folder, e.g. `/Users/maxmustermann/opt/anaconda3/envs/environment_name/bin/python3.10` in Unix-like systems. The site packages should also be found in a similar location, e.g. `/Users/maxmustermann/opt/anaconda3/envs/environment_name/lib/python3.10/site-packages`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, we are ready to build and install. In the library directory created when cloning the library from GitHub, we create a directory for our build. After changing into that directory we build the library and finally install it. For Unix-like systems the commands should be the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "mkdir build && cd build\n",
    "cmake .. -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path_or_alias/to/your/gcc-binary -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path_or_alias/to/your/g++-binary -DPYTHON_LIBRARY_DIR=\"<your_path_to_your_site-packages>\" -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=\"<your_path_to_your_python_binary>\"\n",
    "cmake --build .\n",
    "cmake --install .\n",
    "```\n",
    "(The compiler must only be provided if the GCC is not yet the default compiler. Quotation marks are necessary!)\n",
    "\n",
    "The library should now be installed as a python package. You can confirm by changing into the python site-packages directory and reviewing the content. A shared *openqasmparser* library should now be visible. You could also fire up a python session and try to import the library \n",
    "```\n",
    "python\n",
    "> import openqasmparser as qprs\n",
    ">\n",
    "```\n",
    "If no error message pops up you are ***ready to go!***"

    "## OpenQASM\n",
    "\n",
    "_Open Quantum Assembly Language_ (OpenQASM) is considered to be the de facto standard when it comes to communicating with a quantum computing device. It builds a bridge from describing the circuit on classical hardware to actually implementing it on quantum hardware. Such representation, residing in between the classical and quantum part of the workflow, are called _intermediate representations_. The sole purpose of these intermediate representations is to be able to easily construct quantum circuits and be able to implement those on various different quantum computing devices with (mostly) no additional cost for the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, two major OpenQASM versions are available, [version 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03429) and [3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14722). Version 3 further extends the capabilities of the intermediate representation and provides the user with more advanced possibilities to construct circuits and instruct quantum devices. As they describe it: [In principle, any quantum computation could be described using OpenQASM 2, but there is a need to describe a broader set of circuits beyond the language of qubits and gates.][1] The library presented here is indifferent between the two versions since the more advanced instructions working with the circuit described/generated are not (yet) implemented, neither in the library implementation itself nor in the input representation. Nevertheless, both versions are supported, the only difference is in the headers specific to the specified version used. Both headers can be seen in the following:\n",

    "## Input Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the library is to minimize the effort needed to instruct quantum computing devices. The instruction can happen directly, on quantum hardware level, or using the intermediate representations, e.g. OpenQASM instruction files. Instructing quantum devices manually is too tedious and time consuming for the upcoming larger scale quantum devices and poses a threat for a bottleneck in the quantum computing workflow. Intermediate representations can be constructed once and used on different devices without the need of knowing the exact hardware capabilities of the devices at hand. The library's input representation used could possibly be an intermediate representation by itself, but considering the broad usage and support of OpenQASM using OpenQASM as an intermediate representation simplifies and generalizes the usage on most devices. \n",
    "\n",
    "OpenQASM is a code-like language with which one could write his desired circuits by hand. But even these files will become of such large scale for problems suitable on future more capable devices that writing these by hand will also reach its feasible limits. Therefore, we propose a different representation, easy to generate and well suited for the usage in the variational quantum algorithms context. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Pauli operations form together with the identity a complete basis set, meaning we can construct any arbitrary operation using these four by suitable transformation. They also have an added advantage, since they are such basic operations nearly every quantum computing device has the hardware capabilities to perform these operations directly. The input file to generate can be a simple text file. The Pauli operations are represented by the capital letters *X, Y, Z* and the identity as the capital letter *I*. We now represent the ansatz, a (parameterized) circuit, as an unitary collection of *m* operators which is basically a product of *m* sequentially applied unitaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathbb{U}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = \\mathbb{U}_m(\\theta_m) \\dots \\mathbb{U}_2(\\theta_2) \\mathbb{U}_1(\\theta_1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therfore, our input file consists of *m* lines, one for each operator unitary of the ansatz. Each of the unitaries is composed of multiple gates, parameterized and unparameterized. Looking at a single unitary acting on a system with *N* qubits in its exponentiated form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathbb{U}_i(\\theta_i) = \\exp\\{-i \\theta_i \\hat{a}_i^{\\otimes N}\\} $$\n",
    "where \n",
    "$$ \\hat{a}_i^{\\otimes N} = \\otimes_{l=1}^N \\Theta_{i,l}\\ :\\ \\Theta \\in \\{X,Y,Z,I\\}$$\n",
    "we find the Pauli and identity operations in \\\\(\\hat{a}\\\\). This tensor product will build the foundation of our input representation, where the tensor product of Paulis and identity is written as a string \\\\(S_i\\\\). Consider the unitary \\\\(\\exp{-i \\theta \\sigma_x \\otimes \\sigma_I \\otimes \\sigma_x}\\\\), the string representation as part of the input file to the library would simply be *XIX*. Another variable to set in the input file is the coefficient \\\\(c_i\\\\), seperated from the string by whitespace and in floating point accuracy, corresponding to the real-valued parameter \\\\(\\theta_i\\\\). The last parameter of our input representation if not to be seen in the mathematical description of the operator. In order to group commuting operators together, reducing the computational effort when optimizing the parameters, we introduce an enumerating grouping index \\\\(p_i\\\\). The same index indicates commuting operators, while different grouping index parameters indicate non-commuting operators which must be optimized individually. Putting everything together we have our input representation to generate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A \\equiv \\{(S_i, c_i, p_i)\\ :\\ i \\in \\{1, \\dots m\\}\\} $$\n",

    "$$ \\exp\\{-i \\cdot 1.0 \\cdot \\sigma_y \\otimes \\sigma_y \\otimes \\sigma_I\\} \\exp\\{-i \\cdot 1.5 \\cdot \\sigma_y \\otimes \\sigma_I \\otimes \\sigma_z\\} $$\n",

    "> YYI 1.0 1\n",
    "> \n",

    "Note how the grouping index enumerates, indicating independent operators. The same could be achieved by setting both grouping index parameters to 0, the algorithm then enumerates independent parameters by itself. The same ansatz assuming commuting operators which can be grouped would look similar\n",

    "Some remarks regarding the output. One can see the parameter initialization in the first lines after the header. The numbering actually corresponds to the grouping index. Trying to run this OpenQASM file on a simulator for example would result in an error. To do so, we first have to bind the parameters to the specific \\\\(\\theta\\\\) values. Commuting operators use the same parameter and reduces the computational effort when optimizing since lesser parameters need to be optimized. Other than that, we can also see two numbers being multiplied before that. The second number is the coefficient of the input file. The other number can be set using the multiplier and if not set explicitly is \\\\(2.0\\\\). We explain that in the following, as well as why there are so many rotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "But first, let's look at an actual circuit `test.ansatz`. We can use qiskits functionality to load circuits from OpenQASM files or strings (Additional qiskit modules may be required). I am using the `qasm3` module for v3 and the [`qiskit_qasm2` library](https://pypi.org/project/qiskit-qasm2/) for v2 and their respective `load` (for files) and `loads` (for strings) functionality. Note: To use visualization and/or jupyter notebooks the [visualization extra requirements](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stable/0.24/install.html) are recommended."
